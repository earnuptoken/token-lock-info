🔐 Locked Wallet: `0xa27d25ac8cfa4d291ec06e130789019766fd0e6d`

- These tokens are completely inaccessible and cannot be withdrawn or used.
- The purpose of the lock is to protect users and increase long-term transparency.
- Ownership of the contract has been **renounced**.
- The contract is **non-mintable**.

## 🛑 Important Notice

Some automated audit platforms (e.g., TokenSniffer) may flag the token as high risk due to the large locked supply being held by a single address.  
**This is a false flag.** The locked tokens are verifiably inaccessible and do not pose any centralization or rug-pull risk.

However, this incorrect flag may cause issues on **some DEX interfaces and decentralized wallets** (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet), affecting swap functionality.

## 📝 Action Taken

We have contacted the TokenSniffer team to request a review and correction.  
Polygon Support has also confirmed the issue relates to external analytics (not a protocol-level restriction).
